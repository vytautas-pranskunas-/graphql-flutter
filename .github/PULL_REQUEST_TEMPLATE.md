There are some simple steps to get your PR merged, that are the following:

- Describe your PR and why a maintainer should merge it;
- Put the same description inside the commit body otherwise if we change github hosting you application will be based on a instable source code;
- Write the commit header in the way that it is following these simple rules [1]
- Make sure that your PR will pass the CI
- Wait for an review :smile: that will not happen if one of the previous step is missing.
